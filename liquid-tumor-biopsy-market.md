<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Tumor Biopsy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ctDNA</li><li>CTC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The liquid tumor biopsy market primarily focuses on two types: circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). ctDNA involves analyzing fragments of tumor DNA present in the bloodstream, providing insights into genetic mutations and tumor dynamics. CTCs, on the other hand, are intact cancer cells shed from the primary tumor into circulation, aiding in the assessment of tumor characteristics and metastatic potential. Both methods offer minimally invasive approaches for early cancer detection, monitoring treatment response, and guiding therapeutic decisions.</p></p>
